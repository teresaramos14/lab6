Hello from Docker![0K
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.[0K
[0K
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:[0K
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.[0K
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.[0K
    (amd64)[0K
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the[0K
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.[0K
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it[0K
    to your terminal.[0K
[0K
To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:[0K
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash[0K
